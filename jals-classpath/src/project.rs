//! Project input assembly: the one place that turns a parsed [`Manifest`] plus injected capabilities
//! into the ready-to-use analysis / build inputs every host adapter needs.
//!
//! CLI, LSP, and the browser playground all need the *same* pipeline — resolve `[dependencies]` jars,
//! optionally each dependency's `-sources.jar` `.java` and `git`/`path` source deps, load the classpath
//! `.class` files, synthesize skeleton `.java` for jars that ship no source, and read the project's
//! `[package] edition`. Rather than re-sequence those primitives (and re-invent the warning-formatting,
//! skeleton-append-order, and classpath-fold conventions) in each adapter, this module composes them
//! once behind one call. Adapters supply the capabilities ([`Fetcher`] / [`Git`] / [`FileTree`]) and a
//! single `warn` sink, and receive a [`ProjectInputsIn`] with every resolved input.
//!
//! This is the pure, `wasm32`-compatible core (all I/O through the [`FileTree`] abstraction, the two
//! host capabilities behind traits, the only async step the download). The [`native`](crate::native)
//! facade wraps it with `OsFileTree` + a blocking `reqwest` [`Fetcher`] + a subprocess [`Git`] and
//! returns the `PathBuf`-based [`ProjectInputs`](crate::native::ProjectInputs), adding the manifest's
//! source roots on top.
//!
//! Which optional inputs to assemble is chosen by [`ProjectInputOptions`] — `Analysis` (load the
//! classpath for a `ProjectIndex`), `Compile` (resolve dependency jars + source deps for `javac`,
//! without loading), or `Editor` (everything, for the LSP's full navigation surface).
