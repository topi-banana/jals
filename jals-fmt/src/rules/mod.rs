//! Pluggable formatter rules: the opt-in transformations gathered behind traits and a
//! per-format [`Registry`].
//!
//! Two trait shapes capture the rule families that suit abstraction:
//! - [`LiteralRule`] — a pure text rewrite of a numeric-literal token (`hex-literal-case`,
//!   `float-literal-trailing-zero`, `literal-suffix-case`). Homogeneous and composable, so the
//!   active ones are collected into a [`LiteralRegistry`] and applied in turn.
//! - [`StructuralRule`] — a node-level lowering a rule owns wholesale (`imports` reordering for the
//!   source file, `modifiers` reordering for a `MODIFIERS` node). Dispatched from `lower`'s `match`
//!   by kind, so [`Registry::structural`] is a static O(1) lookup, never a per-node linear scan.
//!
//! Layout-affecting options (brace style, parameter layout, operator separators, …) are *not*
//! modeled here: they are structural dispatch woven through `lower` / `render`, not a discrete list
//! of rules, and `dyn`-dispatching them would add vtable hops on the formatter's hottest path
//! without untangling anything. `trailing-comma` likewise stays a plain function
//! ([`trailing_comma::doc`]) — it has a single static call site and nothing to iterate.
